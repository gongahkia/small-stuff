“Through me you pass into the city of woe:<br>
Through me you pass into eternal pain:<br>
Through me among the people lost for aye.<br>
Justice the founder of my fabric moved:<br>
To rear me was the task of power divine,<br>
Supremest wisdom, and primeval love.<br>
Before me things create were none, save things<br>
Eternal, and eternal I shall endure.<br>
<b>All hope abandon, ye who enter here.</b>”<br>
