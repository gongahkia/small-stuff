# Godot

* Everything in Godot is a Node
* Nodes can contain other Nodes
* Scenes can contain other Scenes
* Node: multiple Nodes comprise a Scene
* Scene: reusable building blocks comprised of Nodes, the equivalent of components in other web frontend frameworks like Svelte or React
* `.gd` script affords more complex logic to Scenes and Nodes placed within Godot's GUI editor
