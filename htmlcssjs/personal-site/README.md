# personal portfolio site version 1

Built in Typescript, HTML and CSS.

## takeaways

* HTML, CSS animation and webpage structuring using flexboxes
* Typescript communication with Github API, rudimentary data parsing and display
* Intuitive UI UX web design
* Proper project structuring
* Deploying website to Github (and relevant restructuring) ++ why I pivoted from Vercel to Github
