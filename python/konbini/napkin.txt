* player must work as a convenience store employee on the NIGHT SHIFT while contending with the demon / entity haunting the store
* use pixel-art on a grid for the main art-style similar to BISTY's tutorial *(make my own sprites)*
1. player must
    1. restock shelves
    2. fix the broken electrical system when the lights randomly off
    3. avoid the entity's sightlines when moving around the store
    4. attend to customers
    5. scan customer's orders
    6. take out the trash
2. entity
    1. walks on a randomised pattern
    2. causes catastrophes that occur randomly, like the lights of the store offing randomly
    3. has bright red eyes so it can be tracked in the dark when the lights have the power outage
    4. give the player a migraine to shuffle words and prevent player from doing tasks like restocking
    5. cause hallucinations that make the store walls and shelves dissapear so only player and it are visible
    6. rearrange the layout of the convenience store (randomly generated rogue-like style)
    7. masquerade as a customer, you must call it out if it is the entity, selling the item without realising will cause you to lose the game
* feature japan-specific monsters and folklore
* inspired vibe-wise by pamali and the mortuary assistant
* include a weight management system and varied enemies
* see miziziz low-res pixel-art and jdh for inspiration
